            <h2>Action Spells (More info soon!)</h2>
            <p> Action Spells are another fun add-on into your Magic: The Gathering experience! There is a rule to them and that is that you can only have one in your hand at a time! These spells work for just about any strategy and adds more fairness to your game!</p>
